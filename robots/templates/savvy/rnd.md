Can you help me get a bulleted list of linear issue's (with titles) that I've worked on since {{previous_friday}}, up to and including {{for_friday}}?

To determine if I've worked on an issue, you can look at both linear and github commit activity for the associated PR.

Also after doing this, can you also use pbcopy to put a comma-separated list of these tickets (ie. 'SC-3022, SC-3037, SC-3038') into my clipboard?
