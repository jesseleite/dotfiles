Can you help me get a bulleted list of linear issue's (with titles) that I've worked on since (but not including) {{previous_friday}}, up to (and including) {{for_friday}}?

To determine if I've worked on an issue:
- You can look at both linear and github commit activity for the associated PR.
- We should probably only include issues/PRs where I've added commits on days within the mentioned date range.
- Don't count merge commits.

Also after doing this, can you also use pbcopy to put a comma-separated list of these tickets, in order by issue number (ie. 'SC-3022, SC-3037, SC-3038'), into my clipboard?
