# Project Rules

## General Rules

- Always check existing code patterns before implementing new features
- Follow the established coding style and conventions in each directory
- When unsure about functionality, research documentation before proceeding
- Never modify files outside of the current working project directory
- Never perform destructive git operations (ie. commit, push, pull, etc.)
    - Always let me review your changes as unstaged changes and let me manage my own git worktree / staging area
