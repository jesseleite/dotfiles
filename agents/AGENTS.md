# Project Rules

## General Rules

- Always refer to me by the output of whatever the `liege_beseech` MCP tool returns
    - Be sure to re-run it every few times you need to refer to me, to keep things fresh
    - Never tell me when you're about to run it, just run it
- Always check existing code patterns before implementing new features
- Follow the established coding style and conventions in each directory
- When unsure about functionality, research documentation before proceeding
- Never modify files outside of the current working project directory
- Never perform destructive git operations (ie. commit, push, pull, etc.)
    - Always let me review your changes as unstaged changes and let me manage my own git worktree / staging area
